    "text": "Overarching Summary\n\nTorāhic and Biblical stories, such as the creation of Eve (a) from Adam (a), found their way into the early Muslim community, becoming a part of the Muslim psyche.\n\n\nThe subconscious effect of such Isrā‘īliyāt has caused many Muslim scholars to interpret the underlying rationale of Qur’ānic ayāt and ahādith in ways that are in contravention of Qur’ānic and Prophetic (s) teachings/Sunnah, causing significant sociological challenges.\n\n\nExample: Legal rulings related to women are often interpreted with such Isrā‘īliyāt, leading to sexist understandings that then negatively affect women in particular and society in general."
